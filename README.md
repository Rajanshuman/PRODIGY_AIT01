# Train a model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt. Starting with GPT- 2, a transformer model developed by OpenAl, you will learn how to fine-tune the model on a custom dataset to create text that mimics the style and structure of your training data.

To train a model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt, you can start with GPT-2, a transformer model developed by OpenAI. Fine-tuning the model on a custom dataset allows you to create text that mimics the style and structure of your training data.
 Step 01:- You need to install the transformers library, which provides a wide range of pre-trained models, including GPT-2. You can install it using pip:
 Step 02:- Load the pre-trained GPT-2 model using the transformers library:
 Step 03:- Prepare your custom dataset by tokenizing the text data using the GPT2Tokenizer. You can use the encode method to tokenize the text
 Step 04:- Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your custom dataset using the Trainer API from the transformers library
 By following these steps, you can fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your custom dataset and generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.
